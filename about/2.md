# What is Authtrail?

Authtrail is a Web3 development platform that delivers a unified API endpoint, which allows Web2 developers to build and deploy Web3 projects, using their existing know-how and preferred frontend language.

No advanced knowledge or experience with blockchain technology is required.
It provides the complete technology stack of connected Polkadot parachains.
It gathers a unique set of tools, SDKs, and documentation to fully support users in building their Web3 products from scratch.
By connecting the Polkadot parachains at one spot, it gives developers a unique opportunity to harness the development potential of their use cases and build complex products in one go, without the need to switch from one parachain to another.
