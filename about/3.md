# AUT token

The AUT token is Authtrail’s native utility token and serves primarily to sustain Authtrail functionalities when interacting with linked Polkadot parachains and transacting with their protocols. 

It represents a uniform means of value exchange in the process of building Web3 projects on the Authtrail platform, as it replaces the need to interact with individual tokens of utilized parachains.

For every value-based action on Authtrail, the platform manages the utility of parachains’ features in their native tokens in the back-end, so that developers only deal with AUT and don’t have to worry about acquiring or exchanging other tokens.

The Authtrail business model also supports payments in EUR and USD, which further boosts adoption among crypto-newbies, and the platform converts it to AUT to unlock Authtrail functionalities.
