# Developing Web3 with Authtrail

Without Authtrail, a developer building a web3 product would need to:
* Have a solid understanding and experience in developing with blockchain technology
* Select a network and/or parachain on which to build a dapp
* Research protocols of the chosen network and/or parachain
* Buy and use network/parachainâ€™s native tokens to use its services
* Learn how to integrate and combine those services
* Build, implement, shift, test, see how users respond, edit and adapt, rinse and repeat
* Maintain their web 3.0 product in the following years, and update according to all protocol changes

With Authtrail, the Web3 development process is radically different.

|     | Time | Funds | No. of Developers | Knowledge | Result
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| From scratch | X months | X $M | 5-10 | Substrate,... | Needs audit/testing |
| With Authtrail | X weeks | X $10k | 1-2 | Python, Java,...? | Works from day 1 |

Authtrail lowers the entry barrier to Web3 and gives developers new, simplified means to create working products on Polkadot parachains simply by using legacy systems and average programming knowledge.

With the complete set of tools, the Authtrail platform aims to support hundreds of developers, regardless of their background, to onboard the Web3 train, and to add a significant share in boosting the adoption of individual Polkadot/Kusama parachains and distributed technologies in the real economy.
