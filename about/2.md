# What is Apillon?

Apillon is a Web3 development platform for developers and businesses building on Web3. By gathering unified API endpoints, it delivers the functionalities of Polkadot parachains adapted to the standard development process and user-preferred technology stack.

It gathers a unique set of tools, ample SDKs, and comprehensive documentation to fully support users in building their Web3 products from day one.

With Apillon, developers can create a complex and fully-functional Web3-based product in just days, harnessing the services provided by different parachains but without the need to employ them individually and from scratch or to spend years mastering the technical knowledge.

This way, they can focus more on the functionalities of their Web3 product than the underlying blockchain complexity and drastically shorten its go-to-market timeline.
